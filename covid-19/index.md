The following project...

## [Modelling COVID-19 in South Africa at a Provincial Level](modelling_covid-19_in_south_africa_at_a_provincial_level.html) 

In this paper we model the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa. Mobility data is used to model the reproduction number of the COVID-19 epidemic over time using Bayesian hierarchical model. Results are calibrated to reported deaths only. 

The version here will be updated roughly daily.

## [Estimating the Reproductive Number of COVID-19](estimating_r.nb.html) 

This paper contains estimates for the reproductive number $R_{t} over time for a number of countries. Read the paper [here](estimating_r.nb.html).

## [Estimating the Reproductive Number of COVID-19 in South Africa](estimating_r_south_africa.nb.html) 

As above, this paper contains estimates for the reproductive number $R_{t} over time for South Africa and it's provinces. Read the paper [here](estimating_r_south_africa.nb.html).
