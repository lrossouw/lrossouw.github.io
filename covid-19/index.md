## [Modelling COVID-19 in South Africa at a Provincial Level](modelling_covid-19_in_south_africa_at_a_provincial_level.html) 

In this paper we model the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa. Mobility data is used to model the reproduction number of the COVID-19 epidemic over time using Bayesian hierarchical model. Results are calibrated to reported deaths only. 

The version here will be updated roughly daily.

## [Estimating the Reproductive Number of COVID-19](estimating_r.nb.html) 

This paper contains estimates for the reproductive number $R_{t} over time for a number of countries including South Africa and details of these measurements at a provincial level for South Africa. Read the paper [here](estimating_r.nb.html).
