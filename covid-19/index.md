## Modelling COVID-19 in South Africa & Canada at a Provincial Level

In these two papers the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa and Canada are modelled at a provincial level. Mobility data is used to model the reproduction number of the COVID-19 epidemic over time using Bayesian hierarchical model. Results are calibrated to deaths only. 

These will be updated roughly once a week.

## Estimating the Reproductive Number of COVID-19

These papers contain estimates for the reproductive number $R_{t} over time for a number of countries including South Africa and details of these measurements at a provincial level for South Africa.
