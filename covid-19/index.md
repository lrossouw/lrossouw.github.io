The following project...

## [Modelling COVID-19 in South Africa at a Provincial Level](modelling_covid-19_in_south_africa_at_a_provincial_level.html) 

In this paper we model the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa. Mobility data is used to model the reproduction number of the COVID-19 epidemic over time using Bayesian hierarchical model. Results are calibrated to excess deaths only. 

The version here will be updated roughly weekly.

## [Estimating the Reproductive Number of COVID-19](estimating_r.html) 

These papers contain estimates for the reproductive number $R_{t} over time for a number of countries including South Africa and details of these measurements at a provincial level for South Africa. 

* [Methodology](estimating_r.html).
* [South Africa](estimating_r_za.html).
* [Canada](estimating_r_ca.html).
* [World Countries](estimating_r_world.html).

The above are updated multiple times per week.
