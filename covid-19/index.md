## [Modelling COVID-19 in South Africa at a Provinical Level](modelling_covid-19_in_south_africa_at_a_provinical_level.html) 

In this paper we model the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa. Mobility data is used to model the reproduction number of the COVID-19 epidemic over time using Bayesian hierarchical model. Results are calibrated to reported deaths only. 

The version here will be updated roughly daily.
