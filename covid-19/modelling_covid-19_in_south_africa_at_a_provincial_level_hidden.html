<p><strong><em>MODEL HAS BEEN UPDATED SIGNIFICANTLY FOLLOWING EMERGENCE OF DELTA VARIANT AND FURTHER REVIEW IS PENDING</em></strong></p>
<div id="introduction" class="section level1" number="1">
<h1 number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>This paper documents a model of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa. Mobility data is used to model the reproduction number of the COVID-19 epidemic over time using a Bayesian hierarchical model. This is achieved by adapting the work by Imperial College London researchers <span class="citation">[1]</span> for South Africa. Authors from Imperial College London have built similar models for Brazil <span class="citation">[2]</span> and the United States <span class="citation">[3]</span>. In this case the model is calibrated to excess deaths <span class="citation">[4]</span> and not case counts or reported COVID-19 deaths.</p>
<p>The model uses mobility movement indexes by province produced by Google <span class="citation">[5]</span>. Furthermore the model includes a fixed effect for interventions introduced at the start of level 4 lockdown.</p>
<p>The model and report are automatically generated on a regular basis using R <span class="citation">[6]</span>. This version contains data available on 08 July 2021.</p>
<p>An online, regularly updated version of this report is <a href="https://unsupervised.online/static/covid-19/modelling_covid-19_in_south_africa_at_a_provincial_level.html">available here</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Incorporated feedback from reviewer 2 and 3.<br />
</li>
<li>Added a <a href="#south-africa">projection for South Africa</a> (based on sum of the provinces).<br />
</li>
<li>Created <a href="projections-mob-base-south_africa_v2-150-daily-20210708.csv">a CSV</a> with the daily projections. See the <a href="#projections">projection section</a> for details.</li>

<li>Remove the under review designation. As at this date the model has feedback from 4 reviewers and also comments from others. The author will continue to update this model and seek review as needed.</li>
<li>Due to mobility increasing from level 3, additional projection scenarios have been introduced involving <a href="#decreased-mobility">decreased mobility</a> (back to level 4 levels).</li>
<li>Numerous updates on plots including some residual plots.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2020-06-10</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remove parks index from average mobility index in line with <span class="citation">[7]</span>. Will drop residential index soon too.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2020-06-20</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Update <a href="#infection-fatality-rates-ifr">IFRs for HIV</a>. Possibly need further increases based on research coming out in near future.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>2020-11-28</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Update infection fatality rates to those from <span class="citation">[10]</span>. These are slightly lower than those from <span class="citation">[11]</span>, <span class="citation">[12]</span> and <span class="citation">[13]</span>.</li>
<li>Add worst case projection.</li>
<li>Add projection output for 31 March 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2020-12-14</strong></p>
<ul>

Previous the initial values of <span class="math inline">\(R_{t,m}\)</span> were shown which in theory would be correct, except that for some provinces the projections only start after lockdown and hence the initial values of <span class="math inline">\(R_{t,m}\)</span> is well below <span class="math inline">\(R_{0,m}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Show estimates of deaths to date.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2021-01-01</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Add projection to 30 June 2021</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2021-01-24</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Align weeks to CDC weeks in step with the source.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2021-04-29</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>2021-06-30</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Allow for increased transmission of Beta variant.</li>
<li>Add the emergence of Delta variant.</li>
<li>Remove provincial intervention and mobility effects to speed up model.</li>

<li>No longer revert AR(2) term to 0 for worst case projection.</li>
<li>Use a single <span class="math inline">\(R_{0}\)</span> for all provinces instead of provincial specific <span class="math inline">\(R_{0,m}\)</span> to simplify the model.</li>
<li>Update many of the charts to show better effects of the parameters of the model for <span class="math inline">\(R_{t,m}\)</span>. Some of the effects will appear larger and smaller but have not changed meaningfully.</li>
</ul>

<div id="methodology" class="section level1" number="3">
<h1 number="3"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Methodology</h1>
<p>A detailed description of the <a href="#detailed-assumptions-and-methodology">methodology and assumptions is provided below below</a>. The key features of the approach employed are summarised here:</p>
<ul>
<li>It uses a Bayesian Hierarchical Model to calibrate model parameters based on observed excess death data and prior assumptions.</li>
<li>Changes in the reproduction number are linked to mobility data <span class="citation">[5]</span>, the introduction of other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), as well as an autoregressive term.</li>
<li>The reproduction number over time is used to model the number of infections occurring over time.</li>
<li>The model uses population-weighted infection fatality ratios (IFRs) by province with some noise added as well as assumptions about the time it takes to die to model deaths from infections.</li>
<li>There is a single combined model for all provinces. This model shares information between provinces, but province-specific effects are also allowed.</li>
<li>The model is fitted such that it uses the prior assumptions about various parameters as well as the excess death data provide an updated parameter distribution and outcome distribution that reflect both the prior assumptions as well as the excess death data.</li>
</ul>

<div id="mobility" class="section level1" number="4">
<h1 number="4"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Mobility</h1>
<div id="national-mobility-data" class="section level2" number="4.1">
<h2 number="4.1"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> National Mobility Data</h2>
<p>The national mobility data from <span class="citation">[5]</span> is plotted below. The model uses the indexes at a provincial level but here the national indexes are plotted for convenience. Clear trends are observable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobility generally reduces before the lockdown on 27 March (except for residential mobility).</li>
<li>There is an increase in mobility in the days just before the lockdown. In particular the Grocery &amp; Pharmacy and Retail indexes. Perhaps an indication of pre-lockdown “panic buying?”</li>
<li>Mobility is relatively stable during level 5 lockdown at low levels.</li>
<li>Mobility increases when level 4 starts.</li>
<li>Mobility dropped at the start of 2021 and has generally been rising since.</li>
</ul>

<p>The chart below summarises the average mobility index used in the model. This is the average of mobility indicators excluding parks and residential. This follows <span class="citation">[7]</span>.</p>

<p>There are some risks to using the mobility data above as it may be biased to the Android operating system, people with smartphones and people with enough data on their smartphone to share their location.</p>
<p>This bias does not really represent a problem though unless it changes over time because then the model would not be able to produce accurate projections. There is a risk that mobility changes disproportionally between users contributing data to these indexes and those not. It would not seem reasonable to expect a major change in the bias over time (unless the calculation is somehow compromised). Provincial biases may exist, but the model does not allow for provincial-specific mobility effects as none was observed in the fitting of the model.</p>

<p>The average mobility (excluding residential &amp; park indexes) is plotted below for the various provinces. From this plot it seems apparent that Western Cape mobility is generally lower than other provinces.</p>

<div id="calibration" class="section level1" number="5">
<h1 number="5"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Calibration</h1>
<p>The sections below show how well the model is reproducing past excess death data. As the model is fitted to past death data we would want to see how well it is reproducing such data. Each section covers a province.</p>
<p>Various panels are plotted for each province:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The first panel shows modelled <em>weekly</em> deaths (blue) and 90% of excess deaths (brown). Bars are plotted at the start of the week (which coincides with <span class="citation">[4]</span>). A good model would produce death forecasts such that the actual reported past deaths would appear in the confidence intervals of the prediction.</li>
<li>The second shows the daily count of deaths reported in the province (brown) and the estimated deaths in blue.</li>
<li>The third panel shows the modelled daily number of infections (blue) compared to confirmed case counts (brown) as reported for the province. Note that this model does not calibrate to case data, but this data is shown for reference. We expect the model to produce infections exceeding confirmed cases as testing is likely only finding a fraction of the true infections.</li>
<li>The fourth panel shows the estimates for reproduction number (<span class="math inline">\(R_{t,m}\)</span>) over time (<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>) for each province (<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>). These values are generating the infections in the model which result in deaths. Note that due to the delay of deaths following infections the last week or two of <span class="math inline">\(R_{t,m}\)</span> values already present an extrapolation from the data. Deaths as a result of these recent infections have generally not occurred as yet.</li>
<li>The final panel shows the impact of the weekly AR(2) effect given a reproduction number of roughly 1. This unexplained value converted to a factor of <span class="math inline">\(R_{t,m}\)</span>. A value greater than 1 indicates that the <span class="math inline">\(R_{t,m}\)</span> was higher than the value implied by other parameters. A value below 1 indicates the reverse.</li>
</ol>
<p>In all the charts the darker shaded area represents a confidence interval of 50% and the lighter shaded area represents a confidence interval of 95%.</p>

<p>The estimated attack rate and cumulative deaths (with 95% confidence intervals) are tabulated below (as at 08 July 2021).</p>
<p>The attack rate is the proportion of the population infected to date. This figure has to be estimated, because many that are infected experience no or mild symptoms, thus they may not seek medical advice and hence will never be tested.</p>
<p>Cumulative deaths are also inexact due to the fact that it’s based off an uncertain proportion of excess deaths which also needs to be projected to the latest date.</p>
<p>The confidence intervals for these estimates remain wide.</p>

<h1 number="9"><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Projections</h1>
<p>One of the reasons we build models is so that we can make sense of the future or indeed the past. We can project forward models to assess the impact of varying assumptions on future outcomes. This gives us a sense of how changes in actions may impact the future. I.e. it allows us to answer “what if” questions. Note however that in projecting the future we are extrapolating, and due care needs to be taken. There are numerous limitations to this model and these projections <a href="#limitations">dicussed below</a> but the author is also of the opinion that the projections add value in that they indicate a significant range across the scenarios projected and in such a manner inform discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All models are wrong but some are useful - George Box <span class="citation">[14]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An incorrect model can be useful because it enables a better understanding of the model and the phenomena being modelled.</p>

<p>Projections are done using constant, increasing and decreasing mobility but other interventions are left constant. It should also be noted that the <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{w_m(t),m}\)</span> are projected forward at constant levels and are not adjusted for projection purposes.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{w_m(t),m}\)</span> is held at “current” levels when projecting forwards. It should be noted that these levels are set 28 days prior as recent deaths only affect infections that occurred prior to that. Based on the observed calibration for Western Cape there is a possibility that this may be resulting in too low recent infections.</p>
<div id="no-change-in-mobility" class="section level2" number="9.1">
<h2 number="9.1"><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> No change in Mobility</h2>
<p>In this projection mobility is held constant at current levels. Level 4 interventions are left intact. It is also assumed that the AR(2) term remains at current levels.</p>
<p>The result of this scenario as at 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2021 are tabulated below. Note based on these it would appear that some provinces have already reached the peak in daily deaths.</p>

<h1 number="10"><span class="header-section-number">10</span> Discussion</h1>
<p>There remains significant uncertainty with all matters relating this epidemic. This includes uncertainty in data, assumptions and many epidemiological and medical matters relating to this disease. It is therefore likely that the model will not be accurate. It is also reflected in the wide confidence intervals of many of the results of the model.</p>
<p>Some researchers have gone as far as to say that it is not possible to accurately estimate the mean number of fatalities of pandemics based on data (<span class="citation">[15]</span> &amp; <span class="citation">[16]</span>). This would indicate the goal of the paper may be futile.</p>
<p>This paper has however attempted to allow for uncertainty using the Bayesian approach here which results in at least some distribution of possible results, some of which are definitely catastrophic and some of which are less severe.</p>
<div id="limitations" class="section level2" number="10.1">
<h2 number="10.1"><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> Limitations</h2>
<p>This analysis has various limitations. A few are highlighted below but there are many. Perhaps the most important being the lack of good quality data.</p>
<ul>
<li>The model is based on somewhat limited data for South Africa. In particular the effects of lockdown in some of the provinces may be simple “extrapolations” using the fixed effect (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>) and shared prior of <span class="math inline">\(R_{0,m}\)</span> from other provinces. As these fits are updated with new data though the model should be more accurate for each province resulting in better estimates.</li>
<li>The model is a simplistic high-level single population model for each province. It contains no differentiation by age groups or any further details. This is required to make the hierarchical model manageable. It seems still to provide useful information on potential movements in the epidemic. However, this homogeneity may result in overestimation of attack rates and hence deaths.</li>
<li>Similar to the above point various groups even of the same age may have varying susceptibility to the virus. Varying susceptibility may reduce the effective herd immunity threshold of the disease.</li>
<li>The model does not take account of changes in many interventions that do not impact general mobility such as social distancing, handwashing and testing, tracing and isolation. The model does take account of the average impact of these interventions over time, but changes in these interventions will not be taken account of. It could be argued that the AR(2) autoregressive term is taking account of these factors.</li>
<li>The paper does take account of mask-wearing, workplace screening and other NPIs introduced with the start of level 4 lockdown. This is done approximately and only measures the implementation of the regulation and not actual compliance with the regulations. These parameters may also not be capturing only this effect and may include other effects that occurred at the same time. Similarly these variable may not be fully capturing increased compliance with these regulations over time.</li>
<li>Google Mobility data may not effectively cover the South African population. It is unclear how uniform the coverage is in say lower income populations who may have limited data and hence may not contribute significantly to the mobility indexes. Smartphone penetration in South Africa is estimated to exceed 90% <span class="citation">[17]</span> though. So the representative nature may be driven mainly by access to data as well as how many people have enabled the feature used to generate the data (Location History). Changes in mobility may have a different impact on various segments of the population.</li>
<li>IFR assumptions may be wrong:
<ul>
<li>It is based on Chinese data and may therefore be higher or lower in SA. The IFR employed though has been found consistent with various sources <span class="citation">[18]</span>.</li>
<li>It does not consider health system capacity. In adverse scenarios the IFR is likely to increase if health system capacity is exceeded.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The model assumes an average of 90% of excess deaths are attributable to COVID-19 directly. This may be wrong or in fact change over time.<br />
</li>
<li>The autoregressive term may change in future. In current projections the term is kept constant going forward. If the term changes in future it may result in increased infections and deaths that cannot be projected by the model as is.
<ul>
<li>In times of accelerating spread this would probably result in over-prediction of the epidemic.</li>
<li>In times of slowing spread this may result in under-estimation of future infections.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="pattern-of-spread" class="section level2" number="10.2">
<h2 number="10.2"><span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> Pattern of Spread</h2>
<p>The epidemic starts in most provinces with a relatively high <span class="math inline">\(R_{t,m}\)</span>(based on assumptions). This then reduces as mobility reduces due to lockdown. In some provinces an additional reduction can be seen at the time maskwearing and work place screening is introduced. However in most provinces the epidemic starts spreading during lockdown. The autoregressive term is adjusting to fit the increased numbers of deaths that are observed.</p>
<p>After the above first wave, the spread of the disease slows down. The reason for this slow down in spread is not clear. Some possible interpretations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes in behaviour of the population in response to the epidemic, for example mask wearing compliance or distancing.</li>
<li>Variation in contact rates of individuals may result in the virus infecting those with higher contact rates first, and possibly slowing down as it reaches those with lower contact rates. This may be due to some subsets of the population being more willing or better able to avoid getting infected.<br />
</li>
<li>Inherent variation in susceptibility between individuals resulting in a slow down in infection rates as the pool of lives with high susceptibility is exhausted.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the the first wave has passed there is a relatively long period of limited deaths but from October to December 2020 a second wave emerges through increased deaths from the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and then spreading to the other provinces.</p>
<p>The second wave resulted in increased deaths over December 2020 and January and February 2021. The Beta variant contributed to this wave.</p>
</div>
<div id="relevance-of-ifr" class="section level2" number="10.3">
<h2 number="10.3"><span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> Relevance of IFR</h2>
<p>The IFR is not treated as a parameter but as a constant with random noise. Changes to the IFR will change the modelled infections that correlate with the observed deaths. Sensitivity to the IFR could be modelled.</p>
<p>If the IFR is higher than what is assumed (which would seem likely), we would expect lower attack rates at present and thus the epidemic could result in a higher ultimate death toll as well. A lower than assumed IFR would imply more people have been infected already and we would be further along in the epidemic.</p>
</div>
<div id="variants" class="section level2" number="10.4">
<h2 number="10.4"><span class="header-section-number">10.4</span> Variants</h2>
<p>This model was updated to allow for increased transmission of the Beta variant but not for increases in the infection fatality rate due to the potential of this or other variants being more severe. If this is the case the model may overstate infections to date based on past deaths as well as underestimate future deaths.</p>
<p>Further to the above, the emergence of new variants in South Africa (such as Delta) may result in increased transmission of the virus beyond what is projected in this model.</p>
</div>
<div id="impact-of-interventions" class="section level2" number="10.5">
<h2 number="10.5"><span class="header-section-number">10.5</span> Impact of Interventions</h2>
<p>From the results it is clear that <span class="math inline">\(R_{t,m}\)</span> in some provinces has reduced from the starting values of <span class="math inline">\(R_{0,m}\)</span> and this has slowed the spread of the epidemic in South Africa saving lives. However, in Europe the lockdowns have been able to reduce <span class="math inline">\(R_{t}\)</span> below 1 for various countries <span class="citation">[19]</span>. As shown here, South Africa’s lockdown and other interventions have not been as successful as in most the European countries shown in <span class="citation">[19]</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="mobility-1" class="section level2" number="10.6">
<h2 number="10.6"><span class="header-section-number">10.6</span> Mobility</h2>
<p>Changes in mobility has an impact on the outcomes but the impact is relatively muted. Mobility is supposed to be a measure of the contact rates of individuals. It’s speculated that the measure of mobility is not accurate enough for densely populated neighbourhoods and hence is not a good proxy for contact rates. This may explain the first wave appearing when mobility was low.</p>
<p>Also mobility may not be representative of a broad enough sector of the population and hence not capture the impact of lockdowns appropriately.</p>
<p>Using mobility data is useful not only to measure the impact of government interventions but also to include the societal response to those interventions (as they affect mobility). This means that changes in the reaction to new regulations can be modelled. It may also be useful going forward as many new regulations are introduced possibly at a provincial level to summarise the impact of interventions numerically. From this research it appears that mobility cannot explain the pattern of spread of the epidemic fully.</p>
</div>
<div id="untangling-mobility-and-other-interventions" class="section level2" number="10.7">
<h2 number="10.7"><span class="header-section-number">10.7</span> Untangling mobility and other interventions</h2>
<p>This paper projects mobility changes forward. It can be seen that that as the model assigns some value to initiatives introduced at the start of level 4 around mask wearing and workplace screening. These reduce the impact of increasing mobility such that in the Western Cape the <span class="math inline">\(R_{t,m}\)</span> actually reduced in level 4 compared to level 5.</p>

<h2 number="10.8"><span class="header-section-number">10.8</span> Health system capacity</h2>
<p>When health system capacity is under pressure in various provinces it would seem likely that the mortality rate of infected individuals in those provinces would increase. This model needs to take account of that for two reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Given the relationship between deaths and infections in this model a sudden increase in deaths due to capacity constraints would incorrectly be treated as a rise in infections.</li>
<li>To project the deaths forward accurately, this model needs to allow for future capacity constraints as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>The model does not currently do this.</p>

<div id="autoregressive-term" class="section level2" number="10.9">
<h2 number="10.9"><span class="header-section-number">10.9</span> Autoregressive Term</h2>
<p>Previous versions of the model over predicted deaths to a large degree. The introduction of the autoregressive process as per <span class="citation">[9]</span> to model further residuals has improved this aspect of the model. This term may be reflecting other NPIs, general population awareness and behaviour adjustment or other unmodelled disease effects. However these should be treated as an error term in that they do not aid the understanding of the disease and show deficiencies in this model.</p>
</div>
<div id="worst-case" class="section level2" number="10.10">
<h2 number="10.10"><span class="header-section-number">10.10</span> Worst Case</h2>
<p>The worst case scenario is highly unlikely. It would seem more likely that mask wearing reduces and mobility increases but not to extreme of no mask wearing or full mobility. The AR(2) terms as it tracks other behaviour is also unlikely to go back to 0 as there would probably be response by the population to evidence of surging cases, admissions and deaths by reducing contact rates and hence the reproduction number.</p>
<p>The calculation is nonetheless useful as it shows clearly that an unmitigated spread of the virus could still lead to a large numbers of infections and deaths and that continuous mitigation efforts are required to avoid rising excess deaths.</p>
<p>It should also be noted with the emergence of vaccines that any infections that can be delayed long enough would result in the associated negative health outcomes and deaths to be avoided.</p>

<div id="detailed-assumptions-and-methodology" class="section level1" number="11">
<h1 number="11"><span class="header-section-number">11</span> Detailed Assumptions and Methodology</h1>
<p>The model assumes that the current reproduction number, <span class="math inline">\(R_{t,m}\)</span>, is a function of the initial reproduction number, <span class="math inline">\(R_{0,m}\)</span>, and changes in mobility over time. It then calculates infections as a function of <span class="math inline">\(R_{t,m}\)</span> over time, and then, using these infections calculates deaths from the infections based on a distribution of time to death.</p>
<p>Various prior distributions are assumed. The model structure is similar to that in <span class="citation">[1]</span> and is briefly documented below. The parameters are estimated jointly using a single hierarchical model covering all provinces. This means that data in different provinces are combined to inform all parameters in the model. As per <span class="citation">[1]</span>, fitting was done in R using Stan with an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler.</p>
<div id="the-model" class="section level2" number="11.1">
<h2 number="11.1"><span class="header-section-number">11.1</span> The Model</h2>
<p>The model is documented here but is similar to <span class="citation">[1]</span>. The model assumes a base reproduction number (<span class="math inline">\(R_{0,m}\)</span>) for each province (<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>) and then it models future values of the reproduction number using mobility indexes as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_{t,m}=R_{0}\cdot2\cdot\phi^{-1}(-\alpha \cdot I_{t,m}^{\alpha}-\beta \cdot I_{t,m}^{\beta}+\delta^{beta}\cdot I_{t}^{beta}+\delta^{delta}\cdot I_{t}^{delta}-\epsilon_{w_m(t),m})\)</span></p>

</ul>
<p>It is assumed that COVID-19 deaths are a proportion of excess deaths (<span class="math inline">\(\psi_m\)</span>). Weekly excess deaths are calculated as:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(d&#39;_{t&#39;,m}=\frac{\sum_{week}{d_{t,m}}}{\psi_m}\)</span></p>
<p>Here <span class="math inline">\(t&#39;\)</span> represents time in weeks rather than days.</p>
<p>Weekly excess deaths <span class="math inline">\(D&#39;_{t&#39;,m}\)</span> are assumed to have the following distribution:</p>

<p>It is assumed that:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\phi_1 \sim N^{+}(0,5)\)</span></p>

<div id="prior-assumptions-and-random-noise" class="section level2" number="11.2">
<h2 number="11.2"><span class="header-section-number">11.2</span> Prior Assumptions and Random Noise</h2>
<p>The following assumptions are taken as is from <span class="citation">[1]</span> except where indicated.</p>
<p>Random noise is added to the IFR as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(ifr_{m}^*=ifr_{m}\cdot N(1,0.1)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> are distributed as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\alpha \sim N(0,0.5)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\beta \sim N^{+}(0,1)\)</span></p>
<p>The above distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> has been increased to reflect <span class="citation">[8]</span> which indicated an effect of mask wearing. In this paper a relative risk of 0.56 is indicated for mask wearing in non-health-care settings. The above prior assumption would indicate a 0.62 expected relative risk. <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> is not a parameter in the model used in <span class="citation">[1]</span>.</p>
<p>Then for the provincial specific index effects the following is used:</p>
<p>For Beta variant it is assumed that:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\delta^{beta} \sim N^{+}(0,0.3)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a^{beta} \sim N^{+}(0.5,0.25)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This would imply a mean increase in the reproduction number of approximately 23% if the reproduction number was near 1. <span class="math inline">\(a^{beta}\)</span> would imply a infection fatality rate 50% higher on average.</p>
<p>The increase in the reproduction number is in line with <span class="citation">[20]</span> where it was found that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming 50% immune evasion for Beta, we estimated a 23% (95% CI: 10-37%) increase in transmissibility or a 38% (95% CI: 15-78%) increase of the infectious duration for this variant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A similar assumption is supported by <span class="citation">[21]</span>.</p>
<p>For Delta variant it is assumed that:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\delta^{delta} \sim N^{+}(0.9,0.5)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a^{delta} \sim N^{+}(1,0.5)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This would imply approximately double the reproduction number (if the reproduction number were near 1). This estimate would have wide uncertainty levels. A mean of 1 <span class="math inline">\(a^{delta}\)</span> would imply doubling the infection fatality rate.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(R_{0,m}\)</span> are defined to be distributed normally as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(R_{0,m} \sim N(3.28,\kappa)\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\kappa \sim N^{+}(0,0.5)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{w_m(t),m}\)</span>, the weekly province specific effect above is as described in <span class="citation">[9]</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is modelled as an AR(2) process.</li>
<li>It has a stationary standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_w\)</span>.<br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{1,m} \sim N(0,\sigma^*_w)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{w,m} \sim N(\rho_1\epsilon_{w-1,m}+\rho_2\epsilon_{w-2,m},\sigma^*_w)\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\rho_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_2\)</span> are independent with <span class="math inline">\(\rho_1 \sim N(0.8,0.05)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho_2 \sim N(0.1,0.05)\)</span> both conditioned to be in [0,1].</li>
<li>And <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_w \sim N^+(0,0.2)\)</span></li>
<li>Then standard deviation of the weekly updates is <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^*=\sigma_w \sqrt{1-\rho_1^2-\rho_2^2-2\rho_1^2\rho_2/(1-\rho_2)}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Infectiousness follows this distribution:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(g \sim Gamma(6.5,0.62)\)</span></p>

<p>A beta distribution is assumed for <span class="math inline">\(\psi_m\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\psi_m \sim B(27,3)\)</span></p>
<p>The above distribution has a mean of 0.9, which is an assumption based on early indications that the majority of excess deaths are due to COVID-19. The distribution above implies that the probability <span class="math inline">\(\psi_m\)</span> is below 0.8 is roughly 0.05.

<p>The age-specific infection attack rates (IAR) was was calculated using the output of the squire R package <span class="citation">[13]</span>. It produces age-specific infection attack rates (IAR). The projection was done using the default parameters for South Africa and the resultant attack rate (<span class="math inline">\(a_{x}\)</span>) for each 5-year age band was obtained (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>).</p>
<p>Per age infection fatality rates from <span class="citation">[10]</span> was used (<span class="math inline">\(ifr_{x}\)</span>). These are slightly lower than those from <span class="citation">[11]</span>, <span class="citation">[12]</span> and <span class="citation">[13]</span>.</p>
<p>Additionally HIV prevalence by age-band and province, <span class="math inline">\(i_{x,m}^{HIV}\)</span> was taken into account from <span class="citation">[23]</span> as well as results from <span class="citation">[24]</span>. In <span class="citation">[24]</span> it is shown that lives with HIV have higher COVID-19 mortality once infected. Based on these results it is assumed to be three times COVID-19 mortality below 55 and double mortality from age 55 upwards (<span class="math inline">\(m_x^{HIV}\)</span>).</p>
<p>These <span class="math inline">\(a_{x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(ifr_{x}\)</span> and HIV adjustments were then applied to the South African population per province and age band as per <span class="citation">[25]</span> and weighted IFRs calculated as follows.</p>

<p>The differences between provinces reflect the different age profiles in those provinces as per <span class="citation">[25]</span> and also differences in HIV prevalence.

<div id="mobility-indexes" class="section level2" number="11.6">
<h2 number="11.6"><span class="header-section-number">11.6</span> Mobility Indexes</h2>
<p>Google has released aggregated mobility data for various countries and for sub-regions in those countries. These data are generated from devices that have enabled the Location History in Google Maps. This feature is available both on Android and iOS devices but is off by default.</p>
<p>For South Africa, these data contain the mobility indexes for each province. These are described in <span class="citation">[5]</span> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grocery &amp; pharmacy: Mobility trends for places like grocery markets, food warehouses, farmers markets, specialty food shops, drug stores, and pharmacies.</li>
<li>Parks: Mobility trends for places like local parks, national parks, public beaches, marinas, dog parks, plazas, and public gardens.</li>
<li>Transit stations: Mobility trends for places like public transport hubs such as subway, bus, and train stations.</li>
<li>Retail &amp; recreation: Mobility trends for places like restaurants, cafés, shopping centres, theme parks, museums, libraries, and movie theatres.</li>
<li>Residential: Mobility trends for places of residence.</li>
<li>Workplaces: Mobility trends for places of work.</li>
</ul>
<p>These measure changes in mobility relative to a baseline established before the epidemic. For example, -30% implies a 30% reduction in mobility from pre-COVID-19 mobility.</p>
<p>As per <span class="citation">[7]</span> these data were combined into an average mobility index for each province which was an average of all mobility indexes excluding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Residential</li>
<li>Parks</li>
</ul>

<h1 number="12"><span class="header-section-number">12</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>This paper has set out to show how a Bayesian model can be fitted to the South African data. From the process it becomes clear that there remains significant uncertainty with all matters relating this epidemic. It is therefore likely that the model will not be accurate.</p>
<p>This paper has however attempted to allow for uncertainty using the Bayesian approach here which results in at least some distribution of possible results, some of which are definitely catastrophic and some of which are less severe.</p>
<p>It is hoped that this is a useful contribution to the ongoing research on the epidemic.</p>
